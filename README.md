# Legacy Product Attestations
So you have a product written in a language without any commercial SAST support and customers are asking for SBOM's and/or Attestations.

This repo and these instructions will hopefully help. I've used these techniques for over a decade with reasonably good results.

## Step 1 - CISA Attestation Form
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Securty Agency has a well thought out [Attestation Form](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-software-development-attestation-form)

This is the bare minimum required for U.S. Government agencies.

Sections I and II could be automatically generated by including the information in a file in the repository and some 'gentle massaging'.  Or just entered manually, it't not that much work.

Section III is where things get more interesting..

### CISA Attestation Form Section III
Here's what you'll be attesting to:

1. The software is developed and built in secure environments. Those environments are secured by the following actions, at a minimum:
    1. Separating and protecting each environment involved in developing and building software;
    2. Regularly logging, monitoring, and auditing trust relationships used for authorization and access:
        1. to any software development and build environments; and
        2. among components within each environment;
    3. Enforcing multi-factor authentication and conditional access across the environments relevant to developing and building software in a manner that minimizes security risk;
    4. Taking consistent and reasonable steps to document, as well as minimize use or inclusion of software products that create undue risk within the environments used to develop andbuild software;
    5. Encrypting sensitive data, such as credentials, to the extent practicable and based on risk;
    6. Implementing defensive cybersecurity practices, including continuous monitoring of operations and alerts and, as necessary, responding to suspected and confirmed cyber incidents;
2. The software producer makes a good-faith effort to maintain trusted source code supply chains by employing automated tools or comparable processes to address the security of internal code and third-party components and manage related vulnerabilities;
3. The software producer maintains provenance for internal code and third-party componentsincorporated into the software to the greatest extent feasible;
4. The software producer employs automated tools or comparable processes that check for security vulnerabilities. In addition:
    1. The software producer operates these processes on an ongoing basis and prior to product, version, or update releases;
    2. The software producer has a policy or process to address discovered security vulnerabilities prior to product release; and
5. The software producer operates a vulnerability disclosure program and accepts, reviews, and addresses disclosed software vulnerabilities in a timely fashion and according to any timelines specified in the vulnerability disclosure program or applicable policies.

#### The software is developed and built in secure environments.

You should have policy in place and perhaps SOC2 audits to support most (if not all) of this.  

#### The software producer makes a good-faith effort to maintain trusted source code supply chains by employing automated tools or comparable processes to address the security of internal code and third-party components and manage related vulnerabilities

Control your supply chain.

#### The software producer maintains provenance for internal code and third-party components incorporated into the software to the greatest extent feasible;

#### The software producer employs automated tools or comparable processes that check for security vulnerabilities.

#### The software producer operates a vulnerability disclosure program and accepts, reviews, and addresses disclosed software vulnerabilities in a timely fashion and according to any timelines specified in the vulnerability disclosure program or applicable policies.
