# Legacy Product Attestations
So you have a product written in a language without any commercial SAST support and customers are asking for SBOM's and/or Attestations.

This repo and these instructions will hopefully help. I've used these techniques for over a decade with good results.

## Step 1 - CISA Attestation Form
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Securty Agency has a well thought out [Attestation Form](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-software-development-attestation-form)

Completion of this self-attestation form is the bare minimum required for U.S. Government agencies software procurement. I believe this would satisfy most commercial entities as well.

Sections I and II could be automatically generated by including the information in a file in the repository and some 'gentle massaging'.  Or just entered manually, it't not that much work.

Section III is where things get more interesting.  I'll go over the major points briefly:

> 1. The software is developed and built in secure environments. Those environments are secured by the following actions, at a minimum:

#1 is a fairly broad domain involving IT/Cybersec/Policy.  For now I'm leaving this out of scope as I'll be focusing on the challenges presented by legacy software.

> 2. [The software producer makes a good-faith effort to maintain trusted source code supply chains by employing automated tools or comparable processes to address the security of internal code and third-party components and manage related vulnerabilities;](#cisa-attestation-form-section-iii-2---supply-chain-security)

#2 is your your supply chain security.  

> 3. [The software producer maintains provenance for internal code and third-party components incorporated into the software to the greatest extent feasible;](#cisa-attestation-form-section-iii-3---code-provenance)

#3 is likely best served by producing and maintaining an SBOM (Software Bill Of Materials).

> 4. [The software producer employs automated tools or comparable processes that check for security vulnerabilities. In addition:](#cisa-attestation-form-section-iii-4---toolsprocesses-to-check-code-for-security-vulnerabilities)

#4 This is an area that 'legacy' code bases will struggle with. 

> 5. The software producer operates a vulnerability disclosure program and accepts, reviews, and addresses disclosed software vulnerabilities in a timely fashion and according to any timelines specified in the vulnerability

#5 is outside the scope of this project, for now.

The following sections will dig in deeper.
